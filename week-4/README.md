The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest number that is a factor of each of those numbers.

### TASK 8
Find the factorial of a number n (n!) (1 ≤ n ≤ 12).

### TASK 10

### TAKS 12
Check whether a integer number is palindrome.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same in either direction (left to right or right to left). For example, the number 543345 is a palindrome.
If n is palindrome then write "Yes" and "No" in other cases.

### TASK 1
You are given two integers, one of them is odd and theother one is even.
You need to output the odd one.

### TASK 2
Find the median number of 3 given integers.

### TASK 3
Sort 3 given numbers in an ascending order.

### TASK 4
Check if the point `A` belongs to the circumference.The input data must include:
5 integer numbers: coordinates of the circumference's centre \( (x_0, y_0) \), the circumference's radius \( r \) and the coordinates of the point \( (x_A, y_A) \).If `A` belongs to the circumference, output 1, otherwise output 0. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-if-a-point-lies-inside-outside-or-on-the-circumcircle-of-three-points-a-b-c/">read more</a>

### TASK 5
Check whether the given 4-digit number is a palindrome.
(A palindrome is a number that is read backwards the same way as forwards, e.g. "121").
If the number is a palindrome, output 1, otherwise output 0.

### TASK 6
Write the name of the day by its number.The ouput should be the name of the day (the week starts with Monday).

### TASK 7
Check whether the number of a ticket is lucky or not.
The number of a ticket is a 6-digit number. A ticket is lucky when the sum of the first 3 digits is equal to the sum of the last 3 digits.

### TASK 8
Check whether only one of 2 given numbers is odd.

### TASK 9
Check if all digits of a 3-digit number are different.

### TASK 10
Solve the following equation: ax2+bx+c = 0
Input: Contains 3 integer numbers: a,b,c (|a,b,c|<=1000).
Output: The number of the equation's roots, then all roots in an ascending order. If you cannot do this, output "-1".

### TASK 11
Find the angle between hour and minute hands using time on the analog clock (12-hour format).
In such a clock, the hour hand moves only once per hour.
Input:Contains 2 integer numbers: the values of the hour H (1≤H≤12) and minute M (0≤M≤59) hands.
Output:The angle between the hands in degrees.

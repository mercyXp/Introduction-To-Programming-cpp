# Regular Expressions
`Regex` short for `Regular Expressions` is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.

## Explanation
Imagine you have a `big box of toys`, and you want to find all the `red cars` in that box. Regex (which is short for regular expressions) is like a magic spell that `helps you search for things` in a `big pile` of words or letters, just like finding your red cars among all your toys!

+ How Does It Work?
With regex, you can tell the computer exactly what you're looking for. For example, if you want to find all the words that start with the letter "A," you can use a special code that says, "Hey, look for words that start with A!"
So, if you have a list of words like "Apple," "Banana," and "Avocado," regex helps you find "Apple" and "Avocado" because they both start with "A."

+ Why is it cool?
Regex is super cool because it can help you find things really fast.

Regex in C++ is a powerful tool for searching, validating, and manipulating strings.

## Practice Tasks in C++

### TASK 1
You are given a set of strings separated with line feed characters. Find all the substrings that are in the form of hh:mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59). The output should be all the correct substrings in the order in which they appear in the text, separating each with a line feed character.

### TASK 2
